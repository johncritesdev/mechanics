/*
   LET'S GET A BIT MORE CHALLENGING
   This is a real common use case to create different strings

   ☑️ Declare a variable, "activeUserCount" and set its value to 1
   ☑️ Now, write some code to print a formatted string like so:
       ex. "There is 1 active user"
   ☑️ Change "activeUserCount" to be 2, and run the code again.
       it should say "There is 2 active user" -- which is not ideal
   ☑️ Let's write an if statement to handle either 1, or more users, so...
       -> if there's one user it should say "There IS 1 active USER"
       -> if there's 0 or more than 1: "There ARE 2 active USERS"
       -> (note the difference)
